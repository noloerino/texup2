			% Within a closure, function calls are parsed differently
			% This generates a special kind of token that has the form
			% { fn: "Image", args: "1a.png", kwargs: {} }
			% in addition to the normal properties of a token
			% The preservation of newlines remains to be seen, and should
			% be defined in some file somewhere
			Image("1a.png") % distinguish between kwargs and positional args
			By KCL:
			Math {
				i_1 - i_3 - i_2 = 0 \rightarrow i_1 - i_3 = 2
			}
			By Ohm's Law:
			Math {
				...
			}
			This gives the following matrix:
			Math {
				% normally syntactic sugar for an implicit call to Math preceding,
				% but we're already in a math environment
				Matrix {
					1 -1
					0 0 1
					-2 0 1 -1
					0 4 0 -1
					% use spaces as delimiters b/c latex isn't space sensitive
				} \ % line join
				RowVector {
					i_1 i_3 u_1 u_2
				} \
				RowVector {
					2 5 0 0
				}
			}
			% Just for fun, let's say we want to output
			% \vec{x} = \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\vec{b}
			% (I forget if matrices should be bold or not)
			% uppercase=user-defined, lowercase=wrap in tag
			% also takes in list of types for nested stuff
			Math(vars = { A: Mat, x: vec, b: vec }) {
				x = A^T A b
			}
